 * Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max 2 Transactions Allowed
 *
 * In daily share trading, a trader buys shares and sells them on the same day. If the trader is allowed to make at most 2 transactions in a day, find out the maximum profit that a share trader could have made.
 *
 * You are given an array prices[] representing stock prices throughout the day. Note that the second transaction can only start after the first one is complete (buy->sell->buy->sell).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: prices[] = [10, 22, 5, 75, 65, 80]
 * Output: 87
 * Explanation:
 * Trader will buy at 10 and sells at 22.
 * Profit earned in 1st transaction = 22 - 10 = 12.
 * Then he buys at 5 and sell at 80.
 * Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 5 = 75.
 * Total profit earned = 12 + 75 = 87.
 *
 * Input: prices[] = [2, 30, 15, 10, 8, 25, 80]
 * Output: 100
 * Explanation:
 * Trader will buy at 2 and sells at 30.
 * Profit earned in 1st transaction = 30 - 2 = 28.
 * Then he buys at 8 and sell at 80.
 * Profit earned in 2nd transaction = 80 - 8 = 72.
 * Total profit earned = 28 + 72 = 100.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= prices.size() <= 10^5
 * 1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5
